# Decisions

## D-001 Target selection

- Selected `alexewerlof/micromustache`.
- Fixed upstream commit: `da3420db27b7a2fdfbb768811a1280b34952dc95`.
- Language pair: TypeScript → Go.
- Port Mortem 2026 track: C.
- All 264 upstream unit tests passed during target investigation.
- No clear direct Go port was found within the recorded investigation scope; this is not a claim that none exists anywhere.
- JavaScript-specific object, prototype, getter, stringification, Promise, RegExp, and UTF-16 behavior remains a compatibility warning.
- The complete upstream public API is in scope; it will not be reduced silently.

## D-002 Repository separation

- The preparation repository and submission repository are separate Git repositories.
- This submission repository was created after kickoff.
- No pre-kickoff implementation, upstream Git history, or preparation-repository history was copied into it.

## D-003 Incremental history

- The first commit contains repository foundations only.
- Original tests, the Node.js oracle, and Go implementation will be separate later commits.
- Large initial dump commits are intentionally avoided.
